# Racurated Swift

A while ago, I did [racurated](https://github.com/RACCommunity/racurated).

Today, I [tried to do it again](http://racurated.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/), using Swift.
The really cool thing, if I may, is that the generation of this website uses ReactiveCocoa itself.

## How to

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `make render`
3. Open the `build` folder
4. Congratulate yourself, you deserve it!

## Next Steps

I don't know if this is going any further, but just I guess turning this into a static website engine would be fun?

## But why?

Yes.
